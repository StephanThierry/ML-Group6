Missing tasks Exercise 3:

a

b
Example of transformation of data in logarithmic transformation and/or others?

c
Normalize all relevant variables? We have not currently done this.

d
Explain the predictions of depature delay we found

e


f
Try different hyperparameters
Explain how decisiont trees can be used for regression analysis


g
Use a grid-search to determine a good set of hyperparameters.
When you have found the best model, score your model on the test set. Comment on the result.

h
Nothing has been done in this exercise

i
(Why are we setting 0 values of dep_deplay to mode?)


j
Explain predictions?

k
Explain which model gives the most trustworthy extrapolation

l
Nothing has been done in this exercise (Larger exercise as we need to try many features and algorithms)
